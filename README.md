## Visualization for Music Data
This project delves into the vast and dynamic world of music, recognizing its ever-changing nature 
shaped by evolving trends, genre fusions, and artist creativity. 
Fueled by technological and social advancements, the music industry undergoes constant transformation. 
The goal is to explore a comprehensive music database, unveiling hidden patterns and narratives 
from the past, while seeking to understand the evolution of music. Utilizing effective visualization techniques, 
the project aims to reveal connections between genres, songs, and lyrical preferences, offering a distinctive perspective on the realm of music. 
The motivation stems from a collective passion for music, and the project serves as an opportunity to blend diverse skills in an exploration of music data. 
The ultimate goal is to gain insights into music trends, contributing to the knowledge base in the field and merging personal interests with academic and professional pursuits.

**Our main objectives:**
<br>
1. Visualization of genre popularity trends throughout 1950 to 2019.
2. Visualization of the top 1% most used words (excluding common words like a, an, the, etc.) each year/decade - (1950-2019).
3. Analysis of features/attributes for top songs along the years.

Hopefully, we can contribute our work to music resources as a valuable resource.
